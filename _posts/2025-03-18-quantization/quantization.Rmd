The success of modern neural networks is partly owed to their massive scale. This is particularly true in areas like generative AI, where models often contain billions - or even hundreds of billions - of parameters. Given their size, these models are largely inaccessible on consumer-grade hardware and challenging to deploy cost-effectively in production environments. 

Quantization is one of the most straightforward methods for reducing inference-time hardware requirements.
